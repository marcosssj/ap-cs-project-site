        <h2>Space Explorer</h2>
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1086752457"></a></p>
        <p> This "Space Explorer" is a very fun and interactive game to play.
           It's easy, you just have to use your arrow keys to move the spaceship and try to collect stars, 
           its what increases your score.
            Also avoid hitting the falling meteorites, otherwise its game over and 
            you'll have to restart and your score will also restart. 
            Its really fun, the star and meteorite positioning is completely random. :) </p>

        <h2>Drawing App</h2>
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/ "></a></p>
        <p>I created this project in my computer science class, and this allowed me to draw shapes on a platform, 
          this allowed me to draw in a simple, by creating a simple platform that is easy to understand and to use.</p>
